# K-Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm

This project explores the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm from scratch, without the usage of any machine learning API, to classify the age of abalone using the Abalone dataset provided by the UCI Maching Learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone. The algorithm is evaluated using a train-and-test split as well as by k-fold cross validation method. Special emphasis on optimization to improve time computational complexity is made during the algorithm build by using matrix vs for loop to run each experiment.
